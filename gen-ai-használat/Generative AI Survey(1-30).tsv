1) Most answers have to be double checked so while it helps spotting typos and is useful in general, using llms can add additional overhead to daily tasks for sanity checks.
2) When using online llms in corporate environments, leaking data becomes very easy. I would limit the ability to reach public AI services and would introduce substitutes within companies in order to prevent accidental leaks - if the data is leaked it would be still ""leaked"" to an internal service, or even better to an llm running locally, if the user workstations can support it."

Stronger security and privacy controls	"With well-crafted prompts, it's a useful tool, but not something you can fully rely on.
It struggles with tracking larger project structures and managing dependencies, and the code it generates can include potential security issues.

While it produces working code, it's often not optimal.
For example, it may write something like:

if char.lower() == 'A' or char.lower() == 'a':
    pass

It tends to produce redundant code in larger tasks and doesn't consistently follow principles like DRY or KISS.

Debugging support is also limited. In one case, when I asked it to help with my thesis, it modified the assert logic in my unit tests instead of fixing the actual bug :/ ."
